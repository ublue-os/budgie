To try it:

    rpm-ostree rebase ostree-unverified-registry:ghcr.io/ublue-os/budgie:38

or if you have an NVIDIA GPU:

    rpm-ostree rebase ostree-unverified-registry:ghcr.io/ublue-os/budgie-nvidia:38

## Caveats

- This is using the same official packages as Fedora, but is assembled differently
  - Future images will be based on the official method
  - When that happens these images will just get updated, you probably won't need to reinstall (though you will want to to use Budgie's recommended partition layout)
  - In the meantime enjoy!
- Thanks to @jerbmega for the lightdm workaround!
